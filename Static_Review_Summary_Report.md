## üêõ Issues Identified

| Issue Type            | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manual Code Review    | Error	Line 136	Undeclared variable i in for-loop (implicit global)	Potential runtime errors and scope pollution
Error	Line 175-179	Lightbox close logic may not work as expected	User experience issue with modal closing
Unclear Logic	Line 136-146	Complex DOM manipulation with string templates	Hard to debug and maintain
Best Practice	Multiple <img> tags	Images have alt attributes but some are generic	Could be more descriptive for accessibility
Best Practice	Line 175	cursor: alias on close button	Poor UX - should use pointer instead|
Performance	Line 136-146	Rebuilding entire DOM on filter change	Inefficient rendering |

| SonarQube             |  Bug Line 136 Undeclared variable in for-loop	Critical
Code Smell	Multiple locations Inline styles and scripts mixed with HTML Medium
Security	Line 139-141	Potential XSS via innerHTML with template literals	High|

| Best Practices        | |
Missing	Entire doc No performance requirements for image loading Unclear expectations
Ambiguity Section 2.1 "Responsive design" not quantified	Implementation uncertainty
Missing	Entire doc, no browser compatibility requirements Potential cross-browser issues

## üí¨ Reflection

1. **What did you learn from reviewing this code?**  
 I discovered how easily subtle bugs like undeclared variables can slip into production code, even in relatively simple applications. The use of innerHTML with template literals, while convenient, introduces security considerations I hadn't fully appreciated.


2. **Which part of the code or documentation had the most issues?**  
   The image filtering and display logic (lines 130-150) contained the most concentrated issues:
a) Undeclared variable creating global scope pollution
b) Inefficient DOM rebuilding on every filter change
c) Security concerns with innerHTML usage
d) Complex string templating making maintenance difficult

3. **What testing strategy worked best for you?**  
  
  The layered approach proved most effective:

- Manual line-by-line review caught the undeclared variable and UX issues

- Tool-assisted analysis (SonarQube) identified security and code quality patterns I might have missed

- Category-based checklist (errors, logic, best practices) ensured comprehensive coverage

4. **What was challenging during this assignment?**  
   The most challenging aspects of the analysis included navigating scope determination, where I had to distinguish between code quality issues that warranted reporting and those that were merely stylistic preferences. Security assessment posed another layer of complexity, particularly in evaluating the actual risk associated with using innerHTML in this specific context, which required a nuanced understanding of potential vulnerabilities. Performance trade-offs also demanded careful consideration, as I weighed the inefficiencies of frequent DOM rebuilding against the complexity of implementing more optimized solutions. Lastly, interpreting SonarQube results proved difficult, especially in discerning which warnings were genuinely actionable and which served more as general coding guidelines.
